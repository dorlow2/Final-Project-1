# Title: Probability of Passing IS590PR

## Team Member(s):  Daria Orlowska & Michelle Twist

# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
Given several aspects of a student's familiarity with programming as well as how the course work is graded, we will use this simulation to predict the grade outcome for 590PR. We will be using the syllabus for this course to determine assignment breakdowns, the randomness from group assignments, and variations between graders to determine how well a student will do in this course. 

## Simulation's variables of uncertainty
List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). For each such variable, how did you decide the range and probability distribution to use?  Do you think it's a good representation of reality?
- Familiarity with programming: On a scale of 50 to 100, where 50 to 64 is a beginner, 65 to 79 is intermediate, 80 to 94 is advanced, and 95 to 100 is expert. This assumes that since 590PR requires some prerequisite for entry, all students enter with some fundamental skills.
- Group assignments: In group assignments, the familiarity your group members have with programming.
    - 2 scenarios: either the ability to pick your partner, or being randomly assigned a partner
          - Choose partner: match with someone of equal skill
          - Randomly assigned partner: varying skillset. The idea here is that as a student with less familiarity with programming, you will have a greater change of receiving more points on your assingnment when your partner(s) is at a higher skill than you are. However, if you have more familiarity with programming, you are the greatest disadvantage when you do not have a lot of programming experience and your partner has even less experience. If you have a lot more experience than your partner, this is only a minor disadvantage because you are capable of doing most of the work yourself. The total advantage or disadvantage is averaged based total group members.
                - If matching in skill set, no advantage, disadvantage 10%
                - If 1 skillset above, advantage 5%; below, disadvantage 15%
                - If 2 skillsets above, advantage 10%; below, disadvantage 15%
                - If 3 skillsets above, advantage 15%; ; below, disadvantage 10%
                - If 4 skillsets above, advantage 20%; ; below, disadvantage 5%
    - Groups numbers (2-4)
-  Grader variation: All graders employ varying levels of leniancy when assessing an assignment
                - Easy grader: Grades between 80% and 100%
                - Medium grader: Grades between 70% and 90%
                - Hard grader: Grades between 60% and 80%

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:
Students who have had prior experience coding in Python will be more likely to pass the course with a higher grade than those who came in with little experience. 

## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)
