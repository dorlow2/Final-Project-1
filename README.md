# 590PR Final_Project
Fork from here to create your final project repository.

Two things are different than all the previous assignments in 590PR regarding the permissions settings:

1. Please KEEP the "All_Students" team to have Read access.  
2. Whenever you choose to, you are welcome to change your Final Project repository to private or to public.  This will enable you to list it in your resume, website, or other portfolio.

# Title: Probability of Passing IS590PR

## Team Member(s):  Daria Orlowska & Michelle Twist
(Note: Don't put your email addresses here (which is public).  If a student wants their NAME hidden as well, due to optional FERPA regulations, they can be listed purely by their GitHub ID).

# Monte Carlo Simulation Scenario & Purpose:
Given several aspects of a student's history with programming as well as how the course work is graded, we will use this simulation to predict the grade outcome for a given student. We will be using the syllabus for this course, the randomness from group assignments, and the grader's scale to determine how well a student will do in this course. 

## Simulation's variables of uncertainty
List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). For each such variable, how did you decide the range and probability distribution to use?  Do you think it's a good representation of reality?

## Hypothesis or hypotheses before running the simulation:
Students who have had prior experience coding in Python will me more likely to pass the course with a higher grade than those who came in with little experience. 

## Analytical Summary of your findings: (e.g. Did you adjust the scenario based on previous simulation outcomes?  What are the management decisions one could make from your simulation's output, etc.)

## Instructions on how to use the program:
